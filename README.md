# Microsoft-365-Lab.
Hands-on lab projects in Microsoft 365, Intune, Defender, and security operations


## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aysha

I'm currently training for a SOC Analyst role, with a strong interest in cybersecurity operations, threat detection, and endpoint security. 
While I work hands-on with Microsoft tools like Intune, Autopilot, and Defender for Endpoint, my broader goal is to build a strong foundation in real-world security monitoring and incident response.

 What I'm focusing on:
- SIEM tools and threat detection
- Microsoft Intune & Endpoint hardening
- Security baselines (CIS benchmarks)
- Hands-on labs with real error resolution

I'm building labs and sharing what I learn â€” step-by-step, with screenshots and notes â€” to help others starting out like me. If you're into blue teaming or security ops, feel free to connect!

Open to learning, collaborating, and joining a SOC team soon!
